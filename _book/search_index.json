(programming language)\n \nJava is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers \"write once, run anywhere\",which meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.\nThe original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).\nHistory\n\nThe Java platform and language began as an internal project at Sun Microsystems in December 1990, providing an alternative to the C++/C programming languages. Engineer Patrick Naughton had become increasingly frustrated with the state of Sun's C++ and C application programming interfaces (APIs) and tools, as well as with the way the NeWS project was handled by the organization. Naughton informed Scott McNealy about his plan of leaving Sun and moving to NeXT; McNealy asked him to pretend he was God and send him an e-mail explaining how to fix the company. Naughton envisioned the creation of a small team that could work autonomously without the bureaucracy that was stalling other Sun projects. McNealy forwarded the message to other important people at Sun, and the Stealth Project started.\nThe Stealth Project was soon renamed to the Green Project, with James Gosling and Mike Sheridan joining Naughton. Together with other engineers, they began work in a small office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California. They aimed to develop new technology for programming next-generation smart appliances, which Sun expected to offer major new opportunities.\nThe team originally considered using C++, but rejected it for several reasons. Because they were developing an embedded system with limited resources, they decided that C++ needed too much memory and that its complexity led to developer errors. The language's lack of garbage collection meant that programmers had to manually manage system memory, a challenging and error-prone task. The team also worried about the C++ language's lack of portable facilities for security, distributed programming, and threading. Finally, they wanted a platform that would port easily to all types of devices.\nBill Joy had envisioned a new language combining Mesa and C. In a paper called Further, he proposed to Sun that its engineers should produce an object-oriented environment based on C++. Initially, Gosling attempted to modify and extend C++ (a proposed development that he referred to as \"C++ ++ --\") but soon abandoned that in favor of creating a new language, which he called Oak, after the tree that stood just outside his office.\nBy the summer of 1992, the team could demonstrate portions of the new platform, including the Green OS, the Oak language, the libraries, and the hardware. Their first demonstration, on September 3, 1992, focused on building a personal digital assistant (PDA) device named Star7[1] that had a graphical interface and a smart agent called \"Duke\" to assist the user. In November of that year, the Green Project was spun off to become Firstperson, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Microsystems, and the team relocated to Palo Alto, California.The Firstperson team had an interest in building highly interactive devices, and when Time Warner issued a request for proposal (RFP) for a set-top box, Firstperson changed their target and responded with a proposal for a set-top box platform. However, the cable industry felt that their platform gave too much control to the user, so Firstperson lost their bid to SGI. An additional deal with The 3DO Company for a set-top box also failed to materialize. Unable to generate interest within the television industry, the company was rolled back into Sun.\nJava meets the Web\n\nIn June and July 1994 – after three days of brainstorming with John Gage (the Director of Science for Sun), Gosling, Joy, Naughton, Wayne Rosing, and Eric Schmidt – the team re-targeted the platform for the World Wide Web. They felt that with the advent of graphical web browsers like Mosaic the Internet could evolve into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable TV. As a prototype, Naughton wrote a small browser, WebRunner (named after the movie Blade Runner), renamed HotJava[22] in 1995.\nIn 1994, Sun renamed the Oak language to Java after a trademark search revealed that Oak Technology used the name Oak.[25] Although Java 1.0a became available for download in 1994, the first public release of Java, Java 1.0a2 with the HotJava browser, came on May 23, 1995, announced by Gage at the SunWorld conference. Accompanying Gage's announcement, Marc Andreessen, Executive Vice President of Netscape Communications Corporation, unexpectedly announced that Netscape browsers would include Java support. On January 9, 1996, Sun Microsystems formed the JavaSoft group to develop the technology.[26]\n"},"book/chapter-1/1.2_java_language_specification.html":{"url":"book/chapter-1/1.2_java_language_specification.html","title":"1.2_Java Specification,API,JDK,ID","keywords":"","body":"The Java Language Specification, API, JDK, and IDE\n\nJava syntax is defined in the Java language specification, and the Java library is defined in the Java API. The JDK is the software for developing and running Java programs. An IDE is an integrated development environment for rapidly developing programs.  \n\nComputer languages have strict rules of usage. If you do not follow the rules when writing a program, the computer will not be able to understand it. The Java language specification and the Java API define the Java standards.The Java language specification is a technical definition of the Java programminglanguage’s syntax and semantics. You can find the complete Java language specification at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/.The application program interface (API), also known as library, contains predefined \nclasses and interfaces for developing Java programs. The API is still expanding. You can view and download the latest version of the Java API at http://download.java.net/java8/docs/api.Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways. It comes in  three editions:  \n\nJava Standard Edition (Java SE) to develop client-side applications. The applications  can run standalone or as applets running from a Web browser.  \nJava Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to develop server-side applications, such as Java servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).  \nJava Micro Edition (Java ME) to develop applications for mobile devices, such as cell phones.  \n\nThis book uses Java SE to introduce Java programming. Java SE is the foundation upon  which all other Java technology is based. There are many versions of Java SE. The latest,  Java SE 8, is used in this book. Oracle releases each version with a Java Development Toolkit  (JDK). For Java SE 8, the Java Development Toolkit is called JDK 1.8 (also known as Java 8  or JDK 8).The JDK consists of a set of separate programs, each invoked from a command line, for  developing and testing Java programs. Instead of using the JDK, you can use a Java development  tool (e.g.IntelliJ IDEA,NetBeans, Eclipse, and TextPad)—software that provides an integrated  development environment (IDE) for developing Java programs quickly.

So Let's begin with a simple Java program that displays the message Hello world on the console.The program looks like below:\nHelloWorld.java\n1 public class HelloWorld {\n2     public static void main(String[] args) {\n3         //This is a comment line\n4         System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n5     }\n6 }\noutput\n\nHello World\n\n\n\n\nNote that the line numbers are for reference purposes only; they are not part of the program.\n So, don’t type line numbers in your program.\n\n Line 1 defines a class.Every Java program must have at least one class.Each class has a name.By convention the name start with a Uppercase letter and in this example it is HelloWorld\n Line 2 defines a method called main.The Main method is the entry point where the program begins to execute.The main method here contains just one line:System.out.println(\"Hello World!).This statement display the Hello World message on the console.Notice the parameter passed to the println() method.The type of this parameter is String and must be enclosed in double quotation marks.And notice that every statement in Java ends with semicolon(;).\n Line3 defines a comment line.In Java, comments are preceded by two slashs(//)on a line which called a line comment ,or enclosed between /* and */ on one or serveral lines ,called a block comment or paragraph comment.when compiler sees // it ignores all the text after // on the same line.When it sees /* it scans for the next */ and ignores any text between /*and */.Here are the examples of comments:\n // One line comment in Java\n /* multiline comment in java this is the first line */\n /* this is the second line\nthis is the third line */\n A pair of curly braces in a program forms a block that groups the program's components({}).\n each block begins with opening brace({)and ends with a closing brace(}).And you should notice that once you define an opening brace you must immediately define a closing brace otherwise there will be a missing-brace error here.With modern IDE you don't need to worry this anymore since it will automatically insert the closing brace for each openning brace and in case there are miss pair braces the IDE will detect it and warning the programmer to handle this.\n\nJava source programs are case sensitive.It would be wrong if we replace the main method with Main.\n\n You have seen several special characters (e.g., { }, //, ;) in the program. They are used\n in almost every program. Below table summarizes their uses.\n\n\n\nCharacter\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n{}\nOpening and closing braces\nDenote a block to enclose statements\n\n\n()\nOpening and closing parentheses\nUsed with methods\n\n\n[]\nOpening and closing brackets\nDenote an array\n\n\n//\nDouble slashs\nPrecede a comment line\n\n\n\"\"\nOpening and closing quotation marks\nEnclose a string\n\n\n;\nSemicolon\nMark the end of a statement\n\n\n\nThe most common errors you will possibly make as you learn to programming is the syntax errors.And because of this you will need to confirm the syntax rules.If your program violates a rule-for example, if the semicolon is missing, a brace is missing or a word is misspelled-the Java compiler will report the syntax errors.\nOnce you understand the program before it is easy to write a little bit more complicated one,checkout the source code below:\npublic class HelloWorldMultiMessage {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello world!\");\n           System.out.println(\"Programming with!\");\n           System.out.println(\"Java is Fun!\");\n       }\n   }\n\noutput\nHello world!\nProgramming with!\nJava is Fun!\n\nThese code are farly simple ,just invode the System.out.println() method three times and pass it different String parameter.\ncheckpoint\n\nWhat is a keyword?List some Java keywords.\nIs Java case sensitive?What is the case for Java keywords?\nWhat is a comment?Is the comment ignored by the compiler?How do you denote a comment line and a comment paragraph?\n\n"},"book/chapter-1/1.4_creating_compiling_executing_java_program.html":{"url":"book/chapter-1/1.4_creating_compiling_executing_java_program.html","title":"1.4_Creating Compiling and Executing Java Program","keywords":"","body":"Creating,Compiling and Executing Java Program\nSo far you have already know how to write your first Java program,that is HelloWorld.java but don't know how to let the machine(computer) actually run it.\nWell in java programming before we really executing the program we need to compiling the source-code into byte-code first and then the byte-code can be executed by the JVM.\nPicture blow demonstrate this process:\n\nYou can use any text editor or IDE to create or edit a java source-code file.Then Java compiler translates a Java source file into a Java byte-code file.In this case it translate HelloWorld.java into HelloWorld.class .

Block comments may be used at the beginning of each file and before each method. They can also be used in other places, such as within methods. Block comments inside a function or method should be indented to the same level as the code they describe.\nA block comment should be preceded by a blank line to set it apart from the rest of the code.\n/*\n * Here is a block comment.\n * Block comment can have multi lines.\n */\n\n\nSingle-Line Comments   \nShort comments can appear on a single line indented to the level of the code that follows. \nIf a comment can't be written in a single line, it should follow the block comment format.\nA single-line comment should be preceded by a blank line. Here's an example of a single-line comment in Java code\n   //single line comment using \"//\"\n   if (condition) {\n\n       /* singline coment using \"/* */\" */\n       ...\n   }\n\n\n\nDocumentation comments\nUse javadoc comments (/* ... /) for commenting on an entire class or an entire\nmethod. These comments must precede the class or the method header in order to be extracted\ninto a javadoc HTML file.\nTo see an example of javadoc HTML file ,checkout http://www.andrew-deng.com:83\nIts corresponding Java code is here\n\nHow to use javadoc to generate HTML doc file\nProper Indentation and Spacing\nA consistent indentation style makes programs clear and easy to read, debug, and maintain.\nIndentation is used to illustrate the structural relationships between a program’s components \nor statements. Java can read the program even if all of the statements are on the same long \nline, but humans find it easier to read and maintain code that is aligned properly. Indent each \nsubcomponent or statement at least two spaces more than the construct within which it is nested.\nA single space should be added on both sides of a binary operator, as shown in the following statement:\n   System.out.println(1+1);    Bad Style\n   System.out.println(1 + 1);  Good Style\n\nBlock Styles\nA block is a group of statements surrounded by braces. There are two popular styles, next-line\nstyle and end-of-line style, as shown below.\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Use the println statemetns to display three messages\n        System.out.println(\"More tutorial visit www.andrew-deng.com\");\n\n    }\n\nEnd-of-line style\n\n\n  public static void main(String[] args)\n   {\n        // Use the println statemetns to display three messages\n        System.out.println(\"More tutorial visit www.andrew-deng.com\");\n\n   }\n\nNext-line style\n\n\nEnd-of-line style makes code easy to read whereas Next-line style save space. \nEither Style is OK depends on your personal choice or organizational preference.\nBut i highly recommend to use one style constantly.\nIts always a good choice to use Google Java Style to style the code.\n\n\nHow to setup Google Java Style in IDE\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Java Style Guide\n\n"},"book/chapter-1/1.6_programming_errors.html":{"url":"book/chapter-1/1.6_programming_errors.html","title":"1.6_Programming Errors","keywords":"","body":"Programming Errors\nProgramming errors can be categorized into three types:\n\nsyntax errors\nruntime errors\nlogic errors\n\nSyntax errors\nIn computer science, a syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of \ncharacters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language.\nFor compiled languages, syntax errors are detected at compile-time.\nA program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected. \nFor interpreted languages, however, a syntax error may be detected during program execution.\nJava Syntax errors\nJava, like all other programming languages, has its own syntax. \nSince Java is complied language so the syntax error can be detected at compile-time.\nListing below shows some syntax errors in java programming language.\n1 public class SyntaxErrorDemo {\n2    public static main(String[] args) {\n3        System.out.println(\"hi)\n4    }\n5 }\n\nThese lines of code has three errors:\n\nmissing keyword void before main in line 2\nmissing closing quotation in line 3\nmissing \";\" in line 3\n\nIf i try to compile this program using javac then these errors will apprear:\n \n\nsourcecdoe can be checkout here\n\nRuntime Errors\nA runtime error is a program error that occurs while the program is running. \nThe term is often used in contrast to other types of program errors, \nsuch as syntax errors and compile time errors.\nAn example of runtime errors is division by zero. This happens when the divisor iszero for integer divisions. For instance, the program listing below would cause a runtime error:\npublic class RuntimeErrorDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(1 / 0);\n    }\n}\n\n\nobjc[16390]: Class JavaLaunchHelper is implemented in both /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_144.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java and /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_144.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/libinstrument.dylib.

Which one is undefined.\n Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\n     at chapter1.runtimeerror.RuntimeErrorDemo.main(RuntimeErrorDemo.java:5)\n\nLogic Errors\nLogic errors when the program does not perform the way it should be.There lots of reasons that errors happen.\nFor example code below shows an error:\n   public class LogicErrorDemo {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           System.out.println(9 / 2 + 2);\n       }\n   }\n\nYou expect this program should print 6.5 but actually it prints 6 which is wrong.\nThat is because in Java, the division for integers is the quotient—the fractional part is truncated.\nIn order to get the right answer you should change the 9 / 2 to 9.0 / 2 and the result will be 6.5\nSyntax errors are relative easy to find since the compiler gives the indication as to where the errors came from \nand why they are wrong.\nRuntime errors are not difficult to find to find since the location and reasons are display on the console.\nLogic errors are kind of challenging but don't worry you will get more techniques and skills to solve that as the course continue.\ncheckpoint\n\nWhat are syntax errors (compile errors), runtime errors, and logic errors?\nGive examples of syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.\nIf you forget to put a closing quotation mark on a string, what kind error will be raised?\nIf your program needs to read integers, but the user entered strings, an error would occur when running this program.
