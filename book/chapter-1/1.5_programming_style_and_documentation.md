#Programming Style and Documentation
Programming style is a set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. 
It is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help programmers read and understand source code conforming to the style, 
and help to avoid introducing errors.

Documentation is the body of explanatory remarks and comments pertaining to a program. 
Programming style and documentation are as important as coding. 
Good programming style and appropriate documentation reduce the chance of errors and make programs easy to read. 
This section gives several guidelines.

##Appropriate Comments and Java Comment Styles 
Java programs can have two kinds of comments: implementation comments and documentation comments. 
Implementation comments are those found in C++, which are delimited by /*...*/, and //.
 Documentation comments (known as "doc comments") are Java-only, and are delimited by /** . */. 
 Doc comments can be extracted to HTML files using the `javadoc` tool.

###Implementation comments
- Implementation comments are meant for commenting out code or for comments about the particular implementation.

- Doc comments are meant to describe the specification of the code, from an implementation-free perspective. 
To be read by developers who might not necessarily have the source code at hand.

####Implementation Comment Formats
Most programs use two styles of implementation comments: block, single-line.

1. *Block Comments*

   Block comments are used to provide descriptions of files, methods, data structures and algorithms. Block comments may be used at the beginning of each file and before each method. They can also be used in other places, such as within methods. Block comments inside a function or method should be indented to the same level as the code they describe.

   A block comment should be preceded by a blank line to set it apart from the rest of the code.

   ```$xslt
   /*
    * Here is a block comment.
    * Block comment can have multi lines.
    */
   ```
   
2. *Single-Line Comments*   

   Short comments can appear on a single line indented to the level of the code that follows. 
   If a comment can't be written in a single line, it should follow the block comment format.
   A single-line comment should be preceded by a blank line. Here's an example of a single-line comment in Java code
   ```$xslt
      //single line comment using "//"
      if (condition) {
      
          /* singline coment using "/* */" */
          ...
      }
   ```
   
####Documentation comments
Use javadoc comments (/** ... */) for commenting on an entire class or an entire
method. These comments must precede the class or the method header in order to be extracted
into a javadoc HTML file.

##Proper Indentation and Spacing
A consistent indentation style makes programs clear and easy to read, debug, and maintain.
Indentation is used to illustrate the structural relationships between a programâ€™s components 
or statements. Java can read the program even if all of the statements are on the same long 
line, but humans find it easier to read and maintain code that is aligned properly. Indent each 
subcomponent or statement at least two spaces more than the construct within which it is nested.
A single space should be added on both sides of a binary operator, as shown in the following statement:
```$xslt
   System.out.println(1+1);    Bad Style
   System.out.println(1 + 1);  Good Style
```

## Block Styles
A block is a group of statements surrounded by braces. There are two popular styles, next-line
style and end-of-line style, as shown below.

```$xslt
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Use the println statemetns to display three messages
        System.out.println("More tutorial visit www.andrew-deng.com");

    }
```
<div align="center"><strong>End-of-line style</strong></div>


```$xslt
  public static void main(String[] args)
   {
        // Use the println statemetns to display three messages
        System.out.println("More tutorial visit www.andrew-deng.com");

   }
```
<div align="center"><strong>Next-line style</strong></div>


End-of-line style makes code easy to read whereas Next-line style save space. 
 
Either Style is OK depends on your personal choice or organizational preference.
But i highly recommend to use one style constantly.

Its always a good choice to use `Google Java Style` to style the code.
