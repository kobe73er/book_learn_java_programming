#Summary
- If you want to run Java programs, but not develop them, download the Java Runtime Environment, or JREâ„¢
- JDK is the software for developing and running Java programs.
- The JDK includes the JRE, so you do not have to download both separately.
- A compiler is a software program that translates the source program into a machine language program.
- Java is platform independent, meaning that you can write a program once and run it on any computer.
- The Java source file name must match the public class name in the program. 
Java source code files must end with the `.java` extension.
- Every class is compiled into a separate byte-code file that has the same name as the class and ends with the `.class` extension.
- To compile a Java source-code file from the command line, use the `javac` command.
- To run a Java class from the command line, use the `java` command.
- Reserved words, or keywords, have a specific meaning to the compiler and cannot be used for other purposes in the program.
- In Java, comments are preceded by two slashes (//) on a line, called a line comment, or enclosed between /* and */ on one or several lines, called a block comment or paragraph comment. Comments are ignored by the compiler.Use `/** */` to comment the source-code and use `javadoc` to generate a HTML format document.
- Java source programs are case sensitive.
- Programming errors can be categorized into three types: *syntax errors*, *runtime errors*,and *logic errors*. Errors reported by a compiler are called syntax errors or compile errors. Runtime errors are errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally. Logic errors occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to.
- Use Text Editor or IDE to edit,compile,run and debug your code.Using IDE is a more efficient way.Intellij IDE is highly recommended.
