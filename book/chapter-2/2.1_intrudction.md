> This chapter focus on how to use the programming techniques to solve real world problems.Along the way , you will learn the elementary programming skills.

In Chapter1 we have already learned how to create ,edit ,run your very first Java Program.Now its time to sharp your skills to solve real world problems.We will start from an relative easier problem and meet more complicated problems as we continue learning deep inside.During this process you will learn how to use primitive data types,variables,constants,operators,expressions input & output.

Enough taking!Let's go ahead!
